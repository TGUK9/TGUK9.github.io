Welcome to my blog, i'll be looking to use this blog to cover various topics for system administrators and infosec. My currently job role is System Administrator and cover a wide range of topics from Powershell to Bash, Configuring certificates to making sure SSL/TLS is configured correctly.

Hopefully you find the content useful or interesting, we'll see what peaks my interests :)
